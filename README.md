# Data-Science-portfolio
This is my current Data Science portfolio. By now it consists of guided projects from the "Data Scientist in Python path" from Dataquest, which I have recently finished. Even though the data and the strategy to analyze it was provided by Dataquest, I tried to personalise each project by getting additional insights of the given data, plotting unique and self-explainable graphs, or investigating different Machine Learning algorithms.

### My Data Science projects:

#### Data analysis:

[Data analysis of NYC high schools](https://github.com/alekseikondratenko/Data-Analysis-of-NYC-High-Schools)

[EDA of Star Wars survey](https://github.com/alekseikondratenko/Exploratory-data-analysis-of-Star-Wars-survey)

#### SQL:

[Using SQL to analyze the data of the music store](https://github.com/alekseikondratenko/Using-SQL-to-analyze-the-data-of-the-music-store)

#### Feature engineering and Machine Learning:

[Extensive feature engineering for house prices prediction](https://github.com/alekseikondratenko/Extensive-feature-engineering-foor-house-prices-prediction)

[Predicting car prices using the Machine Learning](https://github.com/alekseikondratenko/Predicting-car-prices-using-machine-learning)

[Predicting bike rentals using multiple ML algorithms](https://github.com/alekseikondratenko/Predicting-bike-rentals-using-multiple-machine-learning-algorithms)

#### Algorithms from the scratch:

[Writing Naive Bayes classifier from the scratch](https://github.com/alekseikondratenko/Writing-Naive-Bayes-classifier-from-scratch)
